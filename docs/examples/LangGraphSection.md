Quick Start

                


              
                
                  
                    
Installation

                    


                  
                    
Basic Example

                    


                


            

            
              
                
                  
                  
Core Concepts

                


              
                
                  
                    
1. State

                    
The state is a dictionary that gets passed between nodes. Each node can read from and update the state.

                  
                  
                    
2. Nodes

                    
Nodes are functions that take the current state and return updates to the state.

                  
                  
                    
3. Edges

                    
Edges define the flow of execution between nodes based on the current state.

                  
                  
                    
4. Conditional Logic

                    
Use conditional edges to create dynamic workflows that branch based on the state.

                  


              


          


        
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                  
State Management

                


              
                
LangGraph uses a state management system to track data as it flows through your workflow. The state is a dictionary-like object that gets updated by each node in the graph.

                
dict:
    return {"counter": state["counter"] + 1, "status": "processing"}

def node2(state: MyState) -> dict:
    return {"status": "completed"}

# Add nodes and edges
workflow.add_node("node1", node1)
workflow.add_node("node2", node2)
workflow.add_edge("node1", "node2")
workflow.set_entry_point("node1")

# Compile and run
app = workflow.compile()
result = app.invoke({"messages": [], "counter": 0, "status": "started"})`}
                  showLineNumbers={true}
                />

            
            
            
              
                
                  
                  
Conditional Logic

                


              
                
You can add conditional edges to create dynamic workflows that branch based on the current state.

                
State:
    value = state["value"]
    return {"value": value, "next": "even" if value % 2 == 0 else "odd"}

def handle_even(state: State) -> State:
    return {"result": f"{state['value']} is even"}

def handle_odd(state: State) -> State:
    return {"result": f"{state['value']} is odd"}

# Create the workflow
workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("process", process_number)
workflow.add_node("even_handler", handle_even)
workflow.add_node("odd_handler", handle_odd)

# Add conditional edges
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "process",
    lambda state: state["next"],
    {
        "even": "even_handler",
        "odd": "odd_handler"
    }
)
workflow.add_edge("even_handler", END)
workflow.add_edge("odd_handler", END)
workflow.set_entry_point("process")

# Compile and run
app = workflow.compile()
result = app.invoke({"value": 42, "next": ""})`}
                  showLineNumbers={true}
                />

            


        
        
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                  
Basic Agent

                
                
A simple agent that can use tools to answer questions.

              
              
                


            
            
            
              
                
                  
                  
Multi-Agent Collaboration

                
                
Multiple agents working together to complete a complex task.

              
              
                


            


        
        
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                  
Advanced Workflow

                
                
A more complex example with error handling and state management.

              
              
                


              
                
                  
                    
Key Features of This Implementation:

                    
                      
Type hints and type checking with TypedDict
