## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Documentation improvements**: Fix typos, improve clarity, add examples
- **New content**: Add new sections, tutorials, or guides
- **Bug fixes**: Fix broken links, incorrect code examples, or UI issues
- **Feature enhancements**: Improve existing components or add new functionality
- **Translations**: Help translate content to other languages

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicating work
2. Create an issue to discuss major changes before implementing them
3. Ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals and scope

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of change:
- `feature/add-langsmith-examples`
- `fix/broken-navigation-links`
- `docs/improve-installation-guide`
- `refactor/update-component-structure`

## Code Style

### TypeScript/React Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new components
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement proper error handling

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Follow the existing design system and component patterns
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible

### Code Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Format code (if Prettier is configured)
npm run format
```

### Component Structure

When creating new components, follow this structure:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from './types';

/**
 * ComponentName - Brief description of what the component does
 * 
 * @param props - Component properties
 * @returns JSX element
 */
export const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic here
  
  return (
    <div className="component-wrapper">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Submitting Changes
